career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I started programming when I was 12. I began with C++ and after two years
      I started using DirectX and learning games development. I got comfortable
      writing efficient and performant code. I started reading games
      development in the UK at university, but after a year I moved to Sweden
      and read Computer Science, still sticking with a focus on performance,
      efficiency and algorithms. I realised I didn't need to work on games
      to be able to have interesting challenges and be able to scratch that itch
      of writing excellent and fast code.
      Since the year I graduated I've been working at Erisma Technologies and am
      still very happy there. I've migrated the entire software suite through one
      generational change and am currently working on multiple large technology
      shifts at the company.
      I am a full stack developer but my passion is in efficiency, solving problems
      that require well designed and written algorithms and performant code, which
      tends to mean I enjoy backend development more.
